          <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>Largely on the basis of the works of the last three years of his life, van Gogh is generally considered one of the greatest Dutch painters of all time.His work exerted a powerful influence on the development of much modern painting, in particular on the works of the Fauve painters, Chaim Soutine, and the German Expressionists.</p>
      <p>The name of van Gogh was virtually unknown when he killed himself: only one article about him had appeared during his lifetime. He had exhibited a few canvases at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris between 1888 and 1890 and in Brussels in 1890; both salons showed small commemorative groups of his work in 1891. One-man shows of his work did not occur until 1892.</p>
      <p>Van Gogh's fame dates from the early years of the 20th century, and since then his reputation has never ceased to grow. A large part of this reputation is based on the image of van Gogh as a struggling genius, working unappreciated in isolation. The dramatic elements of his life—poverty, self-mutilation, mental breakdown, and suicide—feed the drama of this mythology. The notion that his unorthodox talent was unrecognized and rejected by society heightens the legend, as it is just that sort of isolation and struggle that has come to define the modern concept of the artist. This mythical van Gogh has become almost inseparable from his art, inspiring artists to dramatize his saga in poems, novels, films, operas, dance ensembles, orchestral compositions, and a popular song. Wide and diverse audiences have come to appreciate his art, and the record-breaking attendance at exhibitions of his works—as well as the popularity of commercial items featuring imagery from his oeuvre—reveal that, within the span of a century, van Gogh has become perhaps the most recognized painter of all time. The unprecedented prices his works have attained through auction and the attention paid to forgery scandals have only increased van Gogh's stature in the public imagination.</p>

          <h2>Museums and art expositions</h2> <br>
          <h3>The van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam</h3>
        <p>The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam was officially opened to the public on June 2, 1973. Consisting in two buildings, the main building designed by the Dutch arquitect Gerrit Rietveld and a exhibition wing designed by the Japanese architect Kurokawa Kisho (1999). The core of the museum's collection was owned by the van Gogh family after Vincent's demise. In 1962 was donated by Theo's son, Vicent Willem van Gogh, to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, and then the foundation made a permanent loan to the museum. Through the years and bny purchase and donatios the collection has grown.

        <h3>Kröller-Müller Museum</h3>
        <p>The Dutch Museum of art, is not a dedicated museum, but holds the second largest collection of van Gogh's art, including an early version of the "Potato Eaters", "Café Terrace at night", and "Country Road in Provece Night".</p>
      

        <h3>The inmersive experience</h3>
        <p>The Van Gogh Museum manages an official Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience, described as a travelling "3D immersive exhibition" using technology and computer audio-visual techniques to cover the story of Van Gogh's life through images of his works.The first "experience" was in 2016 in Beijing, and it has since been toured globally to Europe, Asia and North America.<br>
              The Meet Van Gogh Experience does not present original artworks, as they are too fragile to travel. The "experience" was designed in collaboration with the London-based museum design consultancy, Event Communications (who designed Titanic Belfast), and it won a 2017 THEA award in the category of Immersive Museum Exhibit: Touring.</p>

Still, the German Lost Art Foundation have a ton of pieces by van Gogh in the missing list. Even pieces acquired by museums not always have a "clear" <abbr title="history of ownership">provenance</abbr>.</p>
          <p>While is not clear number of how many Jewish collector of van Gogh's art existed before the nazi regime, mostly because a lot of they names were erased of the pieces's provenance ir order to make difficult any reclaim attemp.</p>
          <ul>Some of the pieces that had claimed/returned to the previous owners include:
              <li><i>L'Olivette</i>, returned in 1999 to the only surviving family of Max Silbeberg. Silbeberg was an Jewish art collector killed in a concentration camp during in 1942.

              <li><i> The Diggers</i>, was in the Detroit Institute of Arts gifted by a collector. in 2006 Martha Nathan claimed it as a foprmer owner. The Institute fought the claim. The Institute was facing another claim for <i>Vase with carnations</i> owned by Albert and Hedwig Ullman, german jew art dealers. They sold the pain in order to scape to Australia. Again the Institute fought the claim.</li>
              <li>In 2012 an heir of Margarete Mauthner, an German Jew forced into exile, made a claim over <i>Vue des Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer</i> against the collection of Oskarf Reinhart, a Swiss art collector. Another claim was made against Elizabeth Taylor a little aearlier for <i>Vui del l'asile et de la Chapelle de Saint-Rémy</i>. </li>
              <li>Before the WWii the Jewish collector Mendelssohn-Bartholdy owned a many pieces by van Gogh. One oif them <i>Madame Roulin and her baby</i> ended up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY. In 2002 the heirs filled an claim against the Japanese INsurance company that owns <i>Sunflowers</i>.</li>
              <li><i>Langlois Bridge at Arles</i> was taked fropm the Rothschild collection by Nazis, and recovered by the Monument Men, brought back to the Munich Central Collecting Point.</li>

      <p>Vincent written very often, it's believed that he had written arouin 2000 ketters in his life. So, there is a few quotes from this letters that had been sorrounding the internet. </p>
      <ul>
          <li><i>"I dream my painting and I paint my dream".</i></li>
          <li><i>"There is noithing more truly artistic than to love people".</i></li>
          <li><i>“A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke”.</i></li>
          <li><i>“I don't know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes me dream.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk,﻿ but no flowers grow on it.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“If you hear a voice within you say you cannot paint, then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“I put my heart and soul into my work, and I have lost my mind in the process.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“What am I in the eyes of most people — a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person — somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then — even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love in spite of everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion. Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible momentum.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“Close friends are truly life's treasures. Sometimes they know us better than we know ourselves. With gentle honesty, they are there to guide and support us, to share our laughter and our tears. Their presence reminds us that we are never really alone.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?”</i></li>
          <li><i>“Art is to console those who are broken by life.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“If you truly love nature, you will find beauty everywhere.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“I want to touch people with my art. I want them to say 'he feels deeply, he feels tenderly'.”</i></li>
          <li><i>“I try more and more to be myself, caring relatively little whether people approve or disapprove.”</i></li>
